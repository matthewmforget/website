# Mario Game Built with Kaboom.js 🎮🍄

Welcome to my Mario-inspired game, developed using **Kaboom.js**, a powerful game development library that makes creating 2D games a breeze! Dive into the vibrant world of platforming action where you can guide your character through exciting levels filled with challenges.

## 🚀 Game Controls

- **Move Left/Right:** Use the **Left** and **Right Arrow Keys** to navigate your character through the game.
- **Jump:** Press the **Space Bar** to leap over obstacles and enemies, just like our favorite plumber. Jump and hit blocks with your head for suprises!

## 🌟 About Kaboom.js

Kaboom.js is an excellent framework for crafting 2D games, providing a straightforward API and robust features for physics, rendering, and user input. However, it's important to note that **Kaboom.js is not fully optimized for Safari**, which may result in some glitchy behavior if you're using that browser. For the best experience, I recommend using **Chrome** or **Firefox** to enjoy smooth gameplay.

## 🎉 Getting Started

To play the game, simply visit https://matthewmforget.github.io/website. You’ll be transported to a nostalgic world reminiscent of classic platformers!
